# asl-recognizer
Keras and Tensorflow based CNN to identify images as one of 26 classes detailing the signs in the American Sign Language alphabet.

The model used is not currently in this repo because the file is too large, it can be replicated by running the final script and naming 
the created file "200p-model.h5" which is then called when classifying images. 

Looking back at the data (from https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) the images are not of the best quality as some signs are 
positioned incorrectly or have poor lighting. This was more of a proof-of-concept than anythigng else and completed for a software engineering
project for school (@CWcomptech on Twitter)
